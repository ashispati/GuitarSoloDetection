## GuitarSoloDetection

Github Code repository containing scripts and functions used to generate results in my work titled **A Dataset and Method for Guitar Solo Detection in Rock Music**, which was published as a Conference Paper at the [2017 AES (Audio Engineering Society) International Conference on Semactic Audio](http://www.aes.org/conferences/2017/semantic/)
